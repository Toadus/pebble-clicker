Clicker - Tally counter for Pebble

v0.1

Working tally counter for Pebble.  Hardware buttons increment, decrement and reset the count.

TODO:
- Currently using ttf font rendering. Font is at max size possible, given memory restriction.  Switch to PNGs of digits?
- Long hold to reset, instead of short, single press.
